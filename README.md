# Project: Taskive - To-Do List Application

Taskive is a dynamic and responsive to-do list application designed to help users organize their tasks efficiently. Built with a clean user interface, Taskive enables users to manage tasks, organize them into projects, and prioritize them, all while focusing on modular JavaScript and DOM-based content rendering. The project is powered by Webpack for bundling and npm for managing dependencies and scripts. Future updates may include local storage integration for persistent task management.

## Features & Implementation

+ **Dynamic Task Management** – Add, edit, and delete tasks dynamically without page reloads.
+ **Project Organization** – Group tasks into projects for better categorization.
+ **Priority Levels** – Assign priority levels (Low, Medium, High) to tasks.
+ **Responsive Design** – A mobile-first layout ensures smooth usability across all screen sizes.
+ **Customizable Navigation** – Highlight the active navigation item dynamically on selection.
+ **Lucide Icons Integration** – Enhanced UI with modern SVG-based icons.
+ **Webpack Integration** – Bundled assets for optimized performance and code splitting.
+ **npm for Dependency Management** – Simplifies handling project dependencies and scripts.
+ **Future Local Storage Support** – Planned implementation of local storage for task persistence.

## Learning Outcomes

+ Strengthened my understanding of DOM manipulation and event-driven programming.
+ Improved problem-solving skills through debugging and optimizing dynamic UI components.
+ Enhanced my ability to work with modern JavaScript libraries, such as Lucide, for SVG icons.
+ Learned to manage CSS layouts, including Flexbox and transitions, for polished designs.
+ Gained experience in configuring and using Webpack for module bundling.
+ Improved my workflow by leveraging npm scripts for development and production tasks.

### Challenges Faced

+ **DOM Manipulation** – Managing the addition, removal, and dynamic updates of tasks and projects was a significant challenge. I solved this by implementing event delegation and modularizing task-related code.
+ **Dynamic Navigation** – Highlighting the active navigation item required JavaScript logic to toggle classes efficiently.
+ **Icon Customization** – Adjusting Lucide icons' size and placement involved understanding SVG styling and CSS techniques.
+ **Webpack Configuration** – Setting up Webpack to handle ES6 modules, CSS, and assets, while ensuring an optimized build, was a learning curve.
